## Background

As an aspiring entrepreneur and passionate business student at Brigham Young University, I thrive at the intersection of innovation, strategy, and impact. My journey is fueled by a deep curiosity for how great products shape lives and markets, and a systematic drive to bring ideas to execution. I have invested myself in understanding the nuances of product management—finding inspiration in both classroom theory and hands-on projects that push me to think from a user’s perspective.

My education at BYU, alongside a rigorous pursuit of an entrepreneurship minor, has exposed me to the fundamentals of business strategy, organizational behavior, and technical problem-solving. These experiences have given me a foundation in analytics, cross-functional teamwork, and lean experimentation. Building my portfolio and managing various student ventures, I've learned the importance of empathy, clarity, and iteration in product development.

Beyond the classroom, I've worked in roles ranging from sales and coaching to customer relationship management, each strengthening my communication, leadership, and practical business acumen. I am drawn to consulting because it allows me to tackle complex, ambiguous challenges for clients and organizations, often with a product-driven lens.

I am always eager to collaborate, learn, and adapt. Whether developing a digital solution, contributing to a startup, or analyzing business models, my goal is to build value by channeling creative energy, analytic rigor, and genuine empathy for people’s needs.
